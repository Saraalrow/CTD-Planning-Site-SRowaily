  <h3> This is the Webpage I created in FireWorks <a href="file:///Users/CTD-0

    <p> Postive and Negtive pointers about Creating a Webpage in FireWorks </p>
      <p>Postives</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's stright foreward.</li>
        <li>The html of the file is automatically placed by Fireworks.</li>
        <li>The CSS is autimatically put into place easily without using code.</li>
        <li>Fireworks has pages and states instead of just layers. This is great
          for creating multi-page designs and walking through the design w/o having
          to turn layers on and off to demo.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Negtives</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's not as complex as Dreamweaver, which restricts the user.</li>
        <li>The html can't be controled by the user, or it doesn't show up on Fireworks</li>
      </ul>
