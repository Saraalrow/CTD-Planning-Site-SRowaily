  <h3> This is the Webpage I created in FireWorks <a href="file:///Users/CTD-0

    <p> Postive and Negtive pointers about Creating a Webpage in FireWorks </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1. It's stright foreward.<li>
        <li> 2. The html of the file is automatically placed by Fireworks.<li>
        <li> 3. The CSS is autimatically put into place easily without using code.<li>
        <li> 4. Fireworks has pages and states instead of just layers. This is great
          for creating multi-page designs and walking through the design w/o having
          to turn layers on and off to demo.</li>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> 1. It's not as complex as Dreamweaver, which restricts the user. <li>
        <li> 2. The html can't be controled by the user, or it doesn't show up on Fireworks<li>
      </ul>
